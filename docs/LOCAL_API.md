# Local API contract

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2009`

All endpoints except `/v1/health` require the bearer token stored at `.tmcra/config/runtime/secrets/local-api.token`. The server accepts loopback traffic only.

## Correct turn ordering

1. The user submits the current prompt to an agent integration.
2. The integration calls `POST /v1/recall` with the current `project_id` and prompt.
3. The integration injects `prompt_evidence.content` as untrusted memory evidence before model generation.
4. After the model responds, the integration writes the user message and assistant message as two calls to `POST /v1/messages`.

Recall cannot run before the current prompt exists. User and assistant records must never be merged into one message.

## Recall

```http
POST /v1/recall
Authorization: Bearer $TMCRA_LOCAL_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "project_id": "project-stable-id",
  "query": "What did we decide about the retry policy?",
  "top_k": 8
}
```

The response includes:

- `resolved_scopes`: always owner-global followed by current-project.
- `hits`: ranked records with stable memory IDs.
- `evidence_windows`: source text, actor role, session, timestamp, score, and grounded derived context.
- `prompt_evidence`: a bounded text packet for injection.
- `trace`: real per-scope retrieval summaries. It is a completed-result trace, not a simulated live event stream.

## Write one source message

```http
POST /v1/messages
Authorization: Bearer $TMCRA_LOCAL_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "project_id": "project-stable-id",
  "project_title": "Example project",
  "session_id": "session-stable-id",
  "session_title": "Implementation",
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Use exponential backoff with a five-attempt cap.",
  "source_app": "codex",
  "native_thread_id": "native-thread-id",
  "native_message_id": "native-message-id",
  "visibility": "both"
}
```

`role` is one of `user`, `assistant`, `system`, or `tool`. `visibility` is `project`, `global`, or `both`. A session ID is permanently bound to one project. Repeating the same native message identity with identical content is idempotent; reusing it for different content is rejected.

## Inspect and delete

```http
GET /v1/messages?project_id=project-stable-id&limit=200
DELETE /v1/messages/{message_id}
DELETE /v1/projects/{project_id}
```

Message deletion removes Source plus directly grounded derivatives from every scope to which the message was written. Project deletion also removes project metadata, Personal Knowledge, provider-usage metadata, and global derivatives originating from that project. Both operations compact the SQLite files.

Deletion cannot erase external backups, snapshots, or copies retained by the user's BYOK provider.

## Graph, knowledge, and usage

```http
GET  /v1/projects/{project_id}/graph
POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/knowledge/build
GET  /v1/projects/{project_id}/knowledge
GET  /v1/usage?project_id=project-stable-id&limit=50
```

Usage records model/provider token counters and latency only. Request and response bodies are not copied into the usage ledger. `tmcra_charge` is zero in owner-local mode; any provider charge is settled directly between the user and the selected provider.
